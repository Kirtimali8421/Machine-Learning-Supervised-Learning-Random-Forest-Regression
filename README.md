ðŸŒ² Random Forest Regression â€“ Car Price Prediction
This part of the project focuses on Random Forest Regression, an ensemble learning method used to predict continuous outcomes such as car prices.

ðŸ”§ Key Steps:

Dataset preparation and feature selection

Model development using RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.ensemble

Training the model with multiple decision trees

Aggregating predictions from all trees to produce a final output

ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation:

Model performance assessed using RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Visualizations used to showcase model accuracy and prediction trends

ðŸŒŸ Highlights:

Reduces overfitting by combining multiple decision trees

Increases accuracy through ensemble averaging

Handles both linear and non-linear data effectively

No need for feature scaling
